# Netflix Clone Frontend ðŸŽ¬

This is a basic front-end clone of the Netflix landing page created using only HTML and CSS. It was built as a practice project to improve my understanding of how web pages are structured and styled.

## What I Learned
- Structuring a webpage with HTML
- Using CSS for layout, colors, and typography
- Creating sections like headers, banners, and content rows
- Improving responsiveness and alignment

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Getting Started
Just open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the project.

## Future Goals
As a beginner, Iâ€™m planning to learn more about:
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Responsive design using media queries
- Frameworks like React or Tailwind CSS

## License
This project is for learning purposes and is open-source under the MIT License.
